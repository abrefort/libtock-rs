// TODO: Implement this crate, which will be done piece-by-piece. Platform will
// include:
//   1. The Allowed and AllowedSlice abstractions for sharing memory with the
//      kernel
//   2. The PlatformApi trait and Platform implementation.
//   3. A system call trait so that Platform works in both real Tock apps and
//      unit test environments.
